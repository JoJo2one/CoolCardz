                <h5>3.3 Personalised Products</h5>
                If the product includes personalised content selected by you, it is a personalised product (<b>Personalised Product</b>). If it is a standard product which does not include any content selected by you, it is a non-personalised product (<b>Non-Personalised Product</b>).
                <br/>
                It is up to you to ensure the content you have contributed for inclusion in a Personalised Product is correct (for example the content is correctly spelt). You can find sizing information about personalised t-shirts <a href="#">here</a>.

For best results, we advise that you make the image dimensions approximately 1,000 pixels for the smallest edge of your photos. We print images at 300DPI (Dots Per Inch), so if you are scanning the image, we recommend you use this setting. If you try to upload a photo that has a lower resolution or image size, we will accept it however we cannot accept responsibility if your Personalised Product does not meet your expectations.
                <br/>
                By uploading or including any content or material (including but not limited to photographs, graphics, text and other material) (<b>Customer IP</b>) in a Personalised Product, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable licence (including the right to grant sub-licences through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, adapt, distribute and communicate to the public that content or material solely for the purpose of performing our obligations under these Terms and exercising any rights you may grant to us.

You will be held responsible for any fees and third party damages we may have to pay to a third party because of such infringement and you will be liable to reimburse these payments to us in full.

                It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product's correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product's correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order.
                <br/>

                <h4>5 DISPATCH, DELIVERY AND PROVIDING THE PRODUCTS/<h4>
                <h5>5.1 General information</h5>
                The dispatch date is the date that we send the item, not the date that it is delivered.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                During the order process, we will generally notify you of the dispatch dates available and the expected timeframe for receiving your order. However, Coolcardz does not guarantee delivery dates or times, unless a Special Delivery is requested (in which case we will guarantee the delivery date and time). We will make you aware of delivery charges (if any) before you place your order.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For orders that are accepted, unless we inform you otherwise in the order process, we will dispatch the product you have ordered within 5 days of the order.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It is your responsibility to ensure that the postal information you input for delivery is correct.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Errors in the address may cause unnecessary delay and/or result in unsuccessful delivery of your items.

                <br/>
                <h5>5.6 Estimated delivery times</h5>
                Products are delivered by Royal Mail (or another third party carrier from time to time). Estimated delivery times for all UK orders are set out <a href="#">here</a>. These Terms are in relation to deliveries made in the UK only and for delivery times for the Netherlands, US and Australia, please see those applicable separate Terms and Conditions. Please note that only cards can be delivered worldwide.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If the product is a one-off purchase of digital content, such as an eCard, we will make the digital content available to the recipient either immediately, the same day or at 9am on your selected date of delivery, depending on the option you select.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.7 We are not responsible for delays outside our control</h5>
                If our supply of the products is delayed by an event outside our control (such as acts of God, natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics, terrorist attacks, war or threat of war, riots, imposition of sanctions, embargo, or breaking off of diplomatic relations, nuclear, chemical or biological contamination or sonic boom, any laws imposing an export or import restriction, quota or prohibition, or failing to grant necessary licence or consent, collapse of buildings, fire, explosion or accident, industrial action, interruption or failure of utility service) then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event. However, if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to cancel your order and receive a refund for any products you have paid for but not received. Your statutory rights as a consumer are not affected.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.8 If the recipient is not at home when the product is delivered</h5>
                We operate a "Leave Safe" policy. This means that the carrier will attempt delivery at the recipient's address first. If there is no response, they will attempt to leave the product with a neighbour or in a nominated safe place. If the carrier cannot deliver the product in any of these ways, and the product cannot be posted through the recipient's letterbox, the carrier will leave the recipient instructions informing them how to re-arrange delivery or collect the products from a local depot. Please note that flowers delivered by Yodel will be left on the recipient's doorstep regardless.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.9 Re-arranging delivery/collection</h5>
                If no one is available at the recipient's address, it will be your responsibility to re-arrange delivery or make arrangements for collection with the carrier. Instructions on how to do so shall be left at the time of attempted delivery.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.10 When you become responsible for the goods</h5>
                A product which is goods shall be your responsibility from the time we deliver or attempt delivery of the product to the address you gave us.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.11 When you own goods</h5>
                You own a product which is goods once we have received payment in full.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.12 What will happen if you do not give required information to us</h5>
                We may need certain information from you so that we can supply the products, for example, the delivery address. We will contact you to ask for this information. If you do not give us this information within a reasonable time of us asking for it, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may either end the contract (and Section ‎10.2 will apply) or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for supplying the products late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information, we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.13 Reasons we may suspend the supply of products to you</h5>
                We may have to suspend the supply of a product to deal with technical problems or make minor technical changes; update the product to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; or make changes to the product as requested by you or notified by us to you.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.14 Your rights if we suspend the supply of products</h5>
                We will contact you as far in advance as practicably possible to tell you we will be suspending supply of the product.. If we have to suspend the product for longer than 48 hours, we may contact you to cancel your order and refund any sums you have paid. You may contact us to end the contract for a product if we suspend it, or tell you we are going to suspend it, in each case for a period of more than 48 hours and we will refund any sums you have paid in advance for the product in respect of the period after you end the contract.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>5.15 Delivery outside the UK</h5>
                This applies to cards only; no other products can be delivered outside of the UK. In the event that we accept an order for delivery of a card outside of the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands or (for so long as the UK remains within the EU Customs Union) any jurisdiction in the European Economic Area, the recipient will be responsible for all customs formalities, including completion of customs declarations, payment of import taxes levies, duties and satisfying any other regulatory requirements that may be in force in the relevant country of importation. It is your responsibility to ensure that the recipient consents to this.

                <h4>7 OUR RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES</h4>
                <h5>7.1 Minor changes</h5>
                We may have to make minor changes to a product to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements or to implement minor technical adjustments and improvements, for example to address a security threat. Minor changes will not affect your use of the product.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>7.2 Significant changes</h5>
                There may be circumstances where we have to make significant changes to our products. If we do need to make such changes, we will notify you of this.

                <h4>8 YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT</h4>
                <h5>8.1 Your rights</h5>
                Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract, including:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><b>if what you have bought is faulty or misdescribed you may have a legal right to end the contract</b> (or to get the product repaired or replaced or a service re-performed or to get some or all of your money back), see section ‎9.1;</li>
                    <li><b>if you want to end the contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do</b>, see section 8.2;</li>
                    <li><b>if you have just changed your mind about the product</b>, see section 8.3.  You may be able to get a refund if you are within the cooling-off period, but this may be subject to deductions and you will have to pay the costs of return of any goods;</li>
                    <li><b>In all other cases (if we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind)</b>, see section 8.5.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>8.2 Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do</h5>
                If you are ending a contract for a reason set out below, the contract will end immediately, and we will refund you in full for any products which have not been provided. You may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>We have told you about an upcoming change to the product or these Terms which you do not agree to (see section 7.2);</li>
                    <li>we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;</li>
                    <li>there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;</li>
                    <li>we have suspended supply of the products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than 48 hours; or</li>
                    <li>you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>8.3 Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013)</h5>
                For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14 days and receive a refund.
                <br/>
                How long you have depends on what you have ordered and how it is delivered:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><b>Have you bought digital content for download (for example, an eCard)?</b> if so, you have 14 days after the day we email you to confirm we accept your order, or, if earlier, until the email containing the eCard has been opened. If we delivered the digital content to you immediately, and you agreed to this when ordering, you will not have a right to change your mind.</li>
                    <li><b>Have you bought goods (for example, a Non-Personalised Product)?</b> if so you have 14 days after the day you (or the recipient) receives the goods, unless your goods are split into several deliveries over different days. In this case you have until 14 days after the day you (or the recipient) receives the last delivery to change your mind about the goods;</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>8.4 When you don't have the right to change your mind</h5>
                You do not have a right to change your mind in respect of
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Personalised Products;</li>
                    <li>digital products such as eCards after the recipient has opened the email containing the eCard;</li>
                    <li>products which are sealed for health protection or hygiene purposes, once these have been unsealed after you receive them;</li>
                    <li>perishable goods, such as food, drink and flowers, which deteriorate rapidly; and</li>
                    <li>services, once these have been completed, even if the cancellation period is still running.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>8.5 Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind</h5>
                Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind (see clause 8.1) you can still end the contract before it is completed, but you may have to pay us compensation. A contract for goods or digital content is completed when the product is delivered, downloaded or streamed and paid for.  If you want to end a contract before it is completed where we are not at fault and you have not changed your mind, just contact us to let us know. The contract will end immediately and we will refund any sums paid by you for products not provided but we may deduct from that refund reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.

                <h5>9.1 Reporting a problem</h5>
                If you have questions or are unhappy with your order, please contact our Customer Service Team via <a href="#">Webchat</a> or Email (see section 1.2 for contact details). You will need to quote your order number, the email address you have registered and the details of the problem with the order.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We aim to acknowledge any complaint within 14 days and will do our best to resolve it within 28 days. We may ask you to take a photograph of the product to help us communicate with our suppliers and to correct any future problems. Should it be necessary, we will then advise you how to return your item.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We offer 5 days of freshness guarantee for flowers. Please note, because flowers are perishable, we need to be informed of any problem with your order within five days of delivery to give us the best chance of resolving the issue. We reserve the right to refuse a refund or replacement.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If you receive a product from us in error, you must inform our Customer Service Team immediately. Our Customer Service Team will then provide you with instructions on how to return or securely destroy the product.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>9.2 Your legal obligation to return rejected products</h5>
                If you wish to exercise your legal rights to reject products you must return them back to us. If you have ordered a gift, please return the product to the return address stated on the package. If you have ordered a card or flowers, please contact the Customer Service Team for more information.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>9.3 Procedure for returns and refunds </h5>
                We will refund you the price you paid for the products including delivery costs, by the method you used for payment within 14 days from the day on which we receive the product back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product back to us. In all other cases, your refund will be made within 14 days of your telling us you have changed your mind.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>Personalised Products</h6>
                Including cards, mugs, framed cards, t-shirts, alcohol gifts, canvas & acrylics and phone cases.
                <br/>
                Where an item is faulty,  please contact our Customer Service Team via <a href="#">Webchat</a>. We will either ask you to return the item to us within three days of receipt or to take a photo of the item before returning it back to us. You can speak to our Customer Service Team for a Freepost returns address if you do not have one. Your right to return items to us in accordance with these Terms is in addition to any other statutory rights you may have.
                <br/>
                If you are eligible for a refund, we will reimburse the price you have paid for the product(s) onto the credit or debit card that you paid with or to your PayPal account. Alternatively, we may offer to reprint (if applicable) and resend the item free of charge. Please note it is not our policy to offer both a refund and a resend.
                <br/>
                Refunds cannot be given if the fault is a result of your own actions such as product misuse or if personalisation is mis-spelt or if you have uploaded an image of a low resolution or size. Please see section ‎3.3 on Personalised Products for more information.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>Flowers</h6>
                If the recipient receives damaged flowers or they fail to arrive, please contact us immediately so that we can arrange to resend the flowers on the next available delivery date or offer a full or partial refund. The amount of partial refund will depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the flowers.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As is the case with other gifts, it is not our policy to offer both a refund and a resend. Where flowers have been damaged we will normally ask for photographs clearly showing the problem so we can use them to determine what is going wrong with our system or our couriers. Refunds cannot be given for flowers that have died quickly, unless we understand there to be a genuine problem. It is important that flowers are cared for correctly and in line with the instructions provided. Putting them by heat sources or draughts, or failing to change the water will damage them. We include instructions and flower-food with all our arrangements. All flowers should normally last five days or longer, although this varies by variety. In some circumstances, flowers are sent in bud and will not be fully open when they arrive. However, they should open once they have settled at room temperature.
                <br/>
                It is important that we are contacted as soon as possible regarding issues with your order or the product(s) you have ordered. We need to be informed of any issues within three days of the delivery to give us the best chance of successfully resolving the issue.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <br/>
                Please refer to section 8.4 for Non-Personalised Products which cannot be returned.  
                <br/>
                Where an item is faulty,  please contact our Customer Service Team via <a href="#">Webchat</a>. We will either ask you to return the item to us within three days of receipt or to take a photo of the item before returning it back to us. You can speak to our Customer Service Team for a Freepost returns address if you do not have one. Your right to return items to us in accordance with these Terms is in addition to any other statutory rights you may have.
                <br/>
                If you are eligible for a refund, we will reimburse the price you have paid for the product(s) onto the credit or debit card that you paid with or to your PayPal account. Alternatively, we may offer to reprint (if applicable) <i>and</i> resend the item free of charge. Please note it is not our policy to offer both a refund and a resend.
                <br/>
                Please note that if the value of the product has been reduced by any handling of it beyond what is necessary to check whether the product is as expected, we may deduct an amount to reflect that reduction in value from the sum we refund to you. Note that the value of a product may be reduced to nothing if its seal (or similar) is broken.

                    <li>the products are faulty or misdescribed;</li>
                    <li>if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or these terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong;</li>
                    <li>if we, or on behalf of our suppliers, have requested a return of the product due to a product recall.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>9.5 Deductions from refunds if you are exercising your right to change your mind</h5>
                We may reduce your refund of the price (excluding delivery costs) to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The maximum refund for delivery costs will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer. For example, if we offer delivery of a product within 3-5 days at one cost but you choose to have the product delivered within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option.
                <br/>

                <h4>10 OUR RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT</h4>
                <h5>10.1 We may end the contract if you break it</h5>
                We may end the contract for a product at any time by writing to you if:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>you do not, within a reasonable time, allow us to deliver the products to you or the recipient or collect them from us/your local depot.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>10.2 You must compensate us if you break the contract</h5>
                If we end the contract in the situations set out in Section 10.1 we will refund any money you have paid in advance for products we have not provided, but we may deduct or charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your breaking the contract.

                <h4>12  OUR WEBSITE/APP</h4>
                We will always try to ensure that our Website and App is available 24 hours a day. However, we will not be liable if for any reason the Website or App is unavailable at any time, or for any period.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Please note that we run AB price tests on our Website. This is a randomised process by Coolcardz servers when a customer visits our Website. This means that if you are randomly selected, you may have a slightly different browsing experience to other users.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Occasionally, we may provide links to other websites or resources for your convenience. We do not endorse the contents of these websites and are not responsible for their availability or service. We will not be liable in any way for any loss or damage which you may suffer by using those websites. If you decide to access linked third party websites, you do so at your own risk.

                <h4>13 COOLCARDZ REMINDERS</h4>
                <h5>13.1 How to participate</h5>
                You can set up reminders for your upcoming events (<b>Reminder</b>) on your Coolcardz Account or during the checkout process and you may benefit from discounts off such cards from time to time (<b>Reminder Voucher</b>).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>13.2 How it works</h5>
                The Reminder must be set at least 9 days before the date of your event (<b>Event Date</b>). Before your Event Date, we will send you a push/email notification to remind you of the Event Date. This push/email notification includes details about the Reminder Voucher offer (where applicable) which is valid for 7 days.
                <br/>
                Your Reminder Voucher (where applicable) will automatically be generated and applied to your session when you click on the email link or tap on the notification. When you log into your Coolcardz Account, the Reminder Voucher (where applicable) will be applied to your basket.
                <br/>
                Each Reminder is considered to be marketing activity. By setting up Reminders, you are giving Coolcardz permission to email or notify you about the Event Date, even if you are opted-out of other marketing activity (for instance, newsletters). To stop getting Reminders, you need to delete the Reminders that you have set up from your Coolcardz Account.  
                <br/>
                </p>

The relevant card provider's terms and conditions will apply and be shared with you at the point of purchase.  
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <br/>
                Upon activation of a gift card, refunds or credits for the gift card will be the sole responsibility of the relevant card provider only.

                <h4>17  WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU</h4>
                <h5>17.1  We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. </h5>
                If we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>17.2 We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so.</h5>
                This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the products; and for faulty products under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>17.3 We are responsible for damage to your device which results from faulty digital products</h5>
                If faulty digital content e.g. a faulty eCard which we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you and this is caused by our failure to use reasonable care and skill we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage which you could have avoided  by following our advice and/or instructions.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>17.4 We are not responsible for damage or loss arising from your actions</h5>
                We are not responsible for any damage or loss incurred by you when such loss or damage is caused by negligence, wilful misconduct or concealment of information by you (deliberate or otherwise).  
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>17.5 We are not responsible for losses to your business</h5>
                We only supply products for domestic and private use. If you use the products for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

                <h4>18 GENERAL</h4>
                <h5>18.1 Your Coolcardz Account</h5>
                Please note that we do not perform verification checks when you create a Coolcardz Account, and it is therefore important that you provide your real name and a valid email address when signing up. This is to ensure compliance with these Terms and so that our Customer Service Team can perform identity verification if you ever contact us about your order. A valid email address is also required to receive any other communications mentioned in these Terms. We will not be responsible for being unable to verify your identity or not being able to assist with your queries if you have used a fake name or email address.  
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>18.2 Suspension</h5>
                If you are found to be in breach of these Terms, we reserve the right to suspend your Coolcardz Account, you order and all access to Coolcardz's Website and App.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In addition, we are entitled to suspend provision of all or part of our services at any time if we are obliged or advised to comply with an order, instruction or request of any limb of government, or any regulator, court or other competent authority.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>18.3 Change of Terms</h5>
                These Terms may change from time to time and when they do, we will post the new version of the Terms on the Website and the App and flag it appropriately.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>18.4 We may transfer this agreement to someone else</h5>
                We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>18.5 You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else (except that you can always transfer our guarantee)</h5>
                You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree to this in writing. However, you may transfer our guarantee to the recipient who has acquired the product or, where the product is services, any item or property in respect of which we have provided the services. We may require the recipient to whom the guarantee is transferred to provide reasonable evidence that they are now the owner of the relevant product.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>18.6 Nobody else has any rights under this contract (except someone you pass your guarantee on to)</h5>
                This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its Terms, except in respect of the guarantee as explained in clause 18.5.
                <br/>
                <h5>18.7 If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force</h5>
                Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>18.8  Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later </h5>
                Just because we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, it does not mean you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>18.9  Which laws apply</h5>
                These Terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts.
