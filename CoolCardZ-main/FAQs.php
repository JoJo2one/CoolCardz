                <h3>Why can't I change the wording on the front of my card?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We currently have create-your-own cards (you can add your own text and photos), cards which are partly personalisable (you can change part of the text but not the design, or you can add photos but can’t change the text), and ones which can’t be personalised, so we hope you’ll always be able to find something to suit your needs.</li>
                    <li>We understand that some people have special names for their family members outside of the usual Mum/Grandma/Daddy etc. on offer, and we do try to cover a good mix of terms within our range. If you don’t want to completely create your own but have a specific name you use for someone, we suggest choosing one of our partly personalisable cards (e.g. we may not have any ‘Mam’ cards but you can change a ‘Happy Birthday, {Kate}’ message to a ‘Happy Birthday, Mam’.)</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Infringes anyone's copyright: in particular, you must ensure that you either own the copyright in an image or any other content that you wish to include in a personalised product or that you are fully licensed by the copyright owner to include that image or other content in the personalised product.</li>

            <p>
                <h3>Can I use non-English characters?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are currently only able to reproduce/print Standard English text.</li>
                    <li>Although the site may show the International characters/emojis/symbols/characters with accents etc on the preview, it may not print as submitted.</li>
                    <li>Usually the system prints either question marks or small boxes. This indicates a character that is not recognised by the CoolcardZ system and we are unable to reproduce for you.</li>
